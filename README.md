# Timber
An implementation of the Timber! game in C++.
Based on [Beginning C++ Game Programming, Third Edition](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Beginning-C-Game-Programming-Third-Edition), but updated to address breaking changes in SFML 3.0.

As this code is used for educational purposes for C++ beginners, best programming practices are sometimes not followed, if it is pedagogically useful to do so.

## Getting started, the easy way
1. Download this whole repository as a zip file from Github and unzip to a folder.
2. Download the latest version of [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) Community and select the "Desktop development with C++" option during installation.
3. In Visual Studio, select "Open a local folder" and select the folder where the code from step 1 is located. Visual Studio comes with CMake, which will automatically download the correct version of SFML and handle linking libraries when the folder is opened.
